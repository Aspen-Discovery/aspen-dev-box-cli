The Aspen CLI simplifies the management of your Aspen Dev Box, a containerized development environment using Docker Compose. 
This command-line tool offers essential features for an efficient development workflow.

Configuration:

The Aspen CLI assumes that the Aspen Dev Box project is located at a specific directory path. 
The project directory path is specified by the PROJECTS_DIR environment variable accorging to the aspen-dev-box repository readme.

Getting Started:

Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
Set PROJECTS_DIR to your Aspen Dev Box project location.
Run the Aspen CLI commands for efficient containerized development.
